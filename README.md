# rutgersmqf-portfolio-optimization
tldr: Final project done for the OOP1 course in the MQF program. Fall 2023. Implements a portfolio optimization framework in C++.

Data:

Procedure:

#1: Understand the external libraries that will be used and for what purposes:
C++ compiler with C++11 support or higher
QuantLib library
Eigen library (for matrix operations)
NLopt library (for numerical optimization)
Gnuplot and the Gnuplot C++ interface (for plotting)

#2: Getting the data:
Will use preexisting data set of list companies in the Bombay Stock Exchange.

#3: Caluculate historical prices and covariance matrices - using Eigen library in C++

#4: Define the optimization problem and set it up with NLOpt library

#5: Plot the results with GNUPlot

#6: Implement all the above in an object oriented structure with classes and objects for each, i.e., optimize, plotter, marketdata etc.

Results:
